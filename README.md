Mock Portfolio - FEND - Project 1

Hi there!

This is my first HTML/CSS project for the Front-End Nanodegree program!

It's quite basic but it took me a lot of time and effort to pull it off! and it should fulfill the project requirements...

Make sure to check out the responsiveness of the images. They're optimized for best performance! Cool, uh?

I'm loving this...
